# Introduction and Purpose

The purpose of this lab is to practice estimating variance components for random and mixed effect models.

In this lab exercise we will use the Welding School personal survey data.  The data are stored in the file named “weldschoolexp.rds”.  The exposure concentration variables in the dataset consist of *mnconc* and *particulate*, the airborne concentrations of manganese and total particulate, respectively, both in µg/m^3^.    The grouping variable is *subjid*.  Further description of the variables can be found in “Welding School Exposures variables 556 rev021015.docx”, and the background and study design is in the published paper with file name “Baker Blood Mn Review.”

# Getting Started

The companion file *Week5Lecture.Rmd* gives R commands relevant to this lab and applied to the DEMS underground and Snapshot traffic gradient site data.

## Tools for estimating variance components

Below is a summary of R packages.  See the *Week5Lecture.Rmd* file for coding examples.

* Descriptively using `dplyr`
* Random effects models only
    - ANOVA method of moments using `VCA`
    - ANOVA restricted maximum likelihood using `VCA`
* Random effects and mixed models
    - ANOVA restricted maximum likelihood using `lmer` in the `lme4` package
    - ANOVA maximum likelihood using `lmer` in the `lme4` package

## Overview of `lmer` commands

### `lmer` overview
TODO:  ADD discussion of lmer.  E.g., Generic forumula for a random intercept model with all nested factors:  ADD??

### `lmer` random effects coding

Here is a [link](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/13166/rs-lmer-cheat-sheet) to a helpful stackexchange post on `lme4` random effects coding.  Here is a brief summary for categorical (grouping) variable G and continuous variable X where our goal is to have random effects for levels of G:

* Random intercept only: (1|G)
* Random slope only:  (0 + X|G)
* Correlated random slopes and intercepts: (1 + X|G)
* Independent random slopes and intercepts: (1|G) + (0 + X|G)  



# Practice Session

1.  Determine your project for this lab.  
2.	Read in the weldschoolexpo dataset:
a.	Become familiar with your data
b.	How many observations, students, quarters are in your dataset?  How many observations are there per student (average, minimum, maximum)?
c.	Characterize your two outcome variables (airborne measurements of Mn concentration and total particles), and all potential covariates. 
d.	Get a basic understanding of the distribution of the airborne measurements on both the native and log-transformed scale.  What scale do you think you should conduct your variance components analysis on?
For the rest of the practice session we will focus on the Mn concentration variable:
3.	Try to estimate the variance components within and between subject by hand using collapse.  
a.	You may look at the intermediate results (using e.g., tabstat or by summarizations of the collapse result) and try to get more insight from them.
4.	Now use loneway to estimate the variance components.
a.	Do your estimates agree with those from Step 3?  Why or why not?
5.	Now use xtmixed to estimate the variance components.  (Decide whether you want maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood estimates.  Be able to articulate your reason for your choice.)
a.	Do your estimates agree with those from Step 3?  Why or why not?
6.	Decide whether you should add any fixed effects into your model.  
a.	If so, which one(s)?  Why?  (Note:  Make sure to consider science in your answer!)
b.	Compare the variance components from the models with and without fixed effect(s).  What happens to the variance component estimates from Step 5 after you add your selected covariate(s)?  Does this make sense to you?  (Hint:  Consider how your covariate is distributed within and between subjects in the data.)

# Homework Exercises

1.	Repeat the practice session analysis with particulate concentration.  Does this produce any different results? Why or why not?
2.	How do your variance component estimates compare with the DEMS and Snapshot examples we discussed in lecture? 
3.	Report and discuss the results of your analysis of Mn and total particulate for this lab, touching on the following points:
a.	The design of the study and structure of the dataset.
b.	The scale of the data on which you did your analysis.
c.	The comparability of variance component estimates using different estimation approaches and some possible reasons for (lack of) comparability.
d.	The impact on the variance component estimates when you include fixed effect(s) in your model and the reason for the change(s) in these data.
e.	Incorporate insights from the Symanski et al and Peretz et al papers.
